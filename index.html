                                    <p>Hey elegant lady, I'm the insect that still now you've preserved on your dining table. Everyday when I see you from the below of the transparent plastic cover of the table I get amazed that how a person can be so kind to a small insignificant creature. I may be dead but for your unearthly caring a part of my soul still gets the chance to watch your generosity. For you I still have the belief on human race that there are still some 'true human' like you. Lastly, I hope your birthday is as special as you are. Happy Birthday!</p> <small>The insect on your table</small>

        <p>Okay, so I've been thinking for about 30 minutes but still can not find out how to start. So, lastly I thought let's just start it with this organic way ffs. Hey did you notice the last word(ffs)? It's a fillup word. You can google to know the full form of this word. It may seem a bit slangish and I could use a nicer version of this word such as fgs(You can check the full form of this word also). But I think you're not just the best student that I ever had also you're a very good friend of mine. So, I'm just trying to make the wish more friendly.</p> <p> Do you know I like to share every little to bigger, funny to serious, meme to philosophical speech with you. Normally I don't share my stuff with anyone except with someone I feel comfortable and worth to share. You're such a wonderful person I've met this year who can understand properly all the things I share without worrying. One of the reason behind this maybe you've got quite similar things matching with me. I mean our thinking are quite same in maximum area.</p> <p>Sometimes I just think you or I could be the carbon copy of each other! Even you have some similar til position like me! Then there came some small dissimilarities which are even better I think. Because you share the interesting stuff about those dissimilarities with me and I share mine. You're such an amazing minded person. Just remain yourself for the rest of your life. Yes, sometimes you may do something wrong or stupid. But Too error is human. Just live with it and deal it. And some mistakes are fine you know! Better keep them. That's make you who you are. (Philosophy mere dilam. Oto bojha lagbena ki bolechi :3 ) </p> <p>Now let's talk about your birthday. I remember you said you are anxious about reaching at the age of 17. That's pretty normal to fear but I think you should count not the candles…rather you should see the lights they give. Count not the years, but the life you live. Do you know you’re older today than yesterday but younger than tomorrow :3 May your Facebook wall be filled with messages from people you never talk to! ;)</p>
        <p>BTW don’t get all weird about getting older! Your age is merely the number of years the world has been enjoying you. And as you get older three things happen. The first is your memory goes, and I can’t remember the other two! Do you know I thought of giving you the cutest gift in the world. But then I realized that is not possible, because you yourself are the cutest gift in the world and you are one of the few people whose birthday I can remember without a Facebook reminder :p </p>
        <p>A small portion of my above writing are inspired from google! I hope you wouldn't mind about that! I wanted to say about some other things also but I guess the writing already is big enough to become an eye-sore to you. And another thing, do you remember, I once said to you whenever you write try to keep the paragraph smaller. But see I myself struggling here to maintain that! I can say now, you were actually right. We should go to the new line when it's necessary. But! we should also try to keep the paragraph smaller ;) My Goodness! Still now I'm making the text just larger and larger. So, I'm just stopping right here.</p>
        <p>Wishing you a wonderful time ahead. Happy birthday Mahek.</p>
